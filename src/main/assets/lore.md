#Game Lore
*In a dark and manly voice*
(sadly we did not have money to pay for a voice actor, use your imagination)

In the near future. 
The really, really near future. 
We mean, look out the window people. 
Well, at least in five minutes or so.

Society was crumbling. 
A pandemic had made sure that all sports are forbidden. 
Husbands had started talking to their wives. 
The world begged for salvation.

The worlds prayers was heard.
Scientists and nerd from universities, and bedrooms, all over the world cleaned they're glasses with dirty handkerchiefs, and got to work.

A new kind of sport.

A new kind of pastime.

This is **Robot Rally!**
